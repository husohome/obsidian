## CMPA intended use and interpretation


Just for reference, a quick summary of the intended interpretation and use of the CMPA scores by its development team is given below:

1. CMPA scores simply tell us what the preferences are at the time the scores are yielded and no more. The scores cannot be directly interpreted as interest, or any reasons why the preferences arise, or how stable the preferences are, or how good a fit a person would be for the major.

2. CMPA scores are strictly within-person. The comparison of oneâ€™s scores to those of another is meaningless, or at least, not the intended way in which CMPA scores are used. The scores are on different scales.

3. CMPA scores are for personal reference and cannot be used in highly consequential scenarios.
