# How I'm going to use Obsidian Note and Tags



# Tags
1. `admin` - for myself, housekeeping stuff
2. `exp` - experimental ideas
3. `to-do` - anything that involves any actions to accomplish; implies that the tasks aren't finished. Once the tasks are finished, please remove the `to-do` tag
	- well actually the idea is that the notes should always be evolving, so you actually would not ever need to mark any note as `preliminary` or `inchoate` or anything like that. Everything is inchoate.
4. `vocab` - vocabulary, expressions that I think of/need on the go


## For

1. ideas/ concepts/ advice
	- write single pages for "idea snippets", attaching sources
	- probability no need to tag them "ideas"

2. experimental ways of doing things
	- try to cover all of these:
		- why/context/what problem is being solved
		- need to do what
		- efforts to try to follow through
		- success/failure/reflection/why
	- have a few notes, and maybe tag them "exp"
	- the "ways" may involve a few "to-do"s
		- tag them "to-do" also

3. to-do
	1. tag all the notes with to-dos "to-do"
	2. for example, [[Recent To-Do List]]
	3. Once the to-dos on a note that involves the `to-do` tag are all done:
		1. if the note is not important, then delete the note altogether
		2. if there's some reflections, experience learned from it, **delete the `to-do` tag** only
	4. delete the notes that are not important once finishing them
	5. 

3. coding projects documentation?
	- not sure if it is good
