 # Inspirations from this
 
 1. maybe summarize the key issues in shortening a test in your dissertation, for example
	 1. reliability
	 2. validity
		 1. construct coverage (can cite)
2. (based on CTT) you can use $s_y\times\(1-r^2\)$ to get the standard error to construct the confidence intervals for how well the short-form predicts the long form 
3. I guess the point here is that no matter if you judgement or statistics-driven approaches, you have problems
4. maybe not include why shortened tests were included?

 > goes against the old psychometric wisdom that many items are needed for  reliable and valid measurement (e.g., Anastasi, 1982, p. 192; Nunnally, 1978,  
p. 243)

> To meet practical limitations on available  time and resources, psychologists increasingly resort to shortened tests to increase  efficiency of testing (e.g., Burisch, 1997; Shrout & Yager, 1989; Stanton, Sinar, Balzer, & Smith, 2002)

> This loss in measurement quality may create bias in the estimated group means  and correlations (Nicewander & Price, 1983; Sijtsma & Emons, 2011) and impair individual decision making (Emons, Sijtsma, & Meijer, 2007; Kruyen, Emons, &  Sijtsma, 2012)


>Previous reviews (Coste et al., 1997; Levy,  1968; Smith et al., 2000) suggested that test constructors tend to take the validity of  the shortened tests for granted and refrain from additional validation research at all

> Our pilot study showed that most  studies report coefficient alpha and rarely report other estimates such as test-retest  reliability. Therefore, to study the effects of test shortening on reliability we rely on the reported coefficient alpha
#  criterion for a good short form!
>Test shortening is considered successful when correlations with the other test are substantial or the number of classification errors is not much  larger for the short test than the longer test.

 # What may be useful for me

1. it reviews how tests are shortened, yay! (Direct quotes)
	1. >To shorten tests, test constructors use statistics-driven strategies, a judgmental strategy, an ad hoc strategy, or a combination of these strategies (Coste, Guillemin,  Pouchot, & Fermanian, 1997; Stanton et al., 2002, p. 44)
	2. >A widely used  **statistical strategy** is to produce a shorter test that has a test-score reliability that  is close to the reliability of the longer test. 
		1. > The statistics-driven strategy is  particularly vulnerable to this problem as this strategy is “blind” to item content,  and the way some statistical methods select items may bias the shortened test’s  validity. In particular, strategies that select items on the basis of their correlation  with other items have a tendency to select items that are similar in content, so  that the content domain of the shortened test may be unintentionally narrowed  (Clark & Watson, 1995; Stanton et al., 2002)
		2. out of 111 tests reviewed 92 used statistical approaches, a single one or some combinations of three statistical approaches were used
			1. > Classical test theory (CTT) approaches  maintain reliability at approximately the same level as in the longer test. This  is achieved by keeping the items in the shortened version that have the highest  correlations with the test score on the longer version (including the item  consideration) or the corrected test score (excluding the item). 
			2. > Factor analytic approaches select items with the highest factor loadings.
			3. > Item-response-theory  methods select the items that have larger item-information functions than other  items. The first items contribute most to the test-information function, thus produc-  ing an estimated latent variable that enables the greatest measurement precision  along the scale.
		3. most statistical approaches targeted reliability instead of validity 
	3. but sometimes, people do use own **judgments**
		1. >The judgmental strategy amounts to selecting items on the basis of expert  judgment of the contents of the items. Experts decide which items best cover
		2. > In general, when test constructors used a judg- mental approach, they typically reported that they decided which items to retain  on the basis of the items’ perceived relevance (e.g., Mason, Linney, & Claridge,  2005)
	4. > Several authors recommend to combine statistics-driven strategies and a judgmental approach to shortening the test (e.g., Coste et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2000). the construct of interest.

3. problems of a statistical approach:
	1. > Using these statistical strategies, the best items are selected (or equivalently, the worst items are removed) even if their quality is not very good  but there are no other items from which one can choose.
4. why did people use shortened tests (out of 70 articles that presented their motivation) ^3dfb81
	1. for improved efficiency (21)
	2. the shortened had superior psychometric properties 22 (improved reliability and validity), show a few citations here
		1. 
	3. 10 tests had content inappropriate for the target populations
	4. > For example, McCarthy,  Pedersen, and D’Amico (2009) found it inappropriate to ask children about sexual  behavior and therefore removed two items from the 15-item short form of the  Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire (Ham, Stewart, Norton, & Hope,  2005)
