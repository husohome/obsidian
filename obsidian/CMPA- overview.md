 ## CMPA overview

CMPA (iKoda, 2017) was designed to practically assist prospective students and anyone curious (e.g., 2nd or 3rd year college students who are at the point of determining a major to complete their degree) in identifying the college majors of their preference out of 50 majors commonly offered across North American colleges. It uses Likert-type and forced-choice items combined with screening criteria to help narrow down on relevant options (Wu, 2021), the design waives respondents the onus of having to complete 50*49/2*7 pairwise comparisons, while the forced-choice questions keep the assessment accurate by making the respondent discriminate their potential preference between majors that are already narrowed down for them. The CMPA content is grounded in reality, in that the items are from real college websites describing what each major really is doing. For more validation, see Wu (2021).
