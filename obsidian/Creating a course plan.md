#java #coding #productivity #productivity-book-keeper #project
part of the [[java project - productivity bookkeeper]] project

## For the first time
1. user hovers on empty space
	- a prompt (a plus sign is shown to allow them to add a table (a course plan object)
2. create a course plan (looks like a table)
	- add, delete, and edit any course
		- each row is a course that has
			- course name
			- a short description of the course
	- the tables are auto-saved
	- each time a row is added, all unique courses are generated at the bottom as cards to allow for the easier creation of more course plans.
		- (optional) a course 
3. once the course plan is done, there should be a save and "go to the weekly scheduler" kind of action; this will lead to a page that would allow you to execute the course plan. This should lead to 
4. of course, dynamically show the number of hours and stuff. [[Scheduling how to execute the course plan (weekly schedule)]]

## Second time onward
1. mix and match the cards to create a plan
	
## other considerate features
1. each course plan should become a collapsible listing, once you click it, the table is shown again
