# To-do (basic execution unit)
#java #coding #productivity #to-do #productivity-book-keeper #project

1. the course execution can be split into to units
	1. course, scheduled hours of work
	2. execution status: has it been done?
2. right-click complete or check the box to check it,
3. sometimes the problem of using a simple to-do list is that the user simply checks all the to-do items to bailout from work, so maybe the user should be able to set some actions required to complete a task, for example (maybe provide the following options), wait but this has implications for the "progress":
	1. write a 50-word (qualitative) reflection about the progress
	2. answer a short (quantitative) survey, maybe a Likert-type scale or so, like "how successful would you rate your completion status..."
	3. both?
4. once the "done" action is done, 
	1. the to-do is updated to "done"
	2. the progress is updated
5. once all the tasks to-dos are done
	1. update the progress in coursePlan
	2. show a "finished" page.
6. provide a function to "move it to next week"?
7. (advanced/ ignore for now) something like a tomato clock
	- options
		- one time: 50 min work + 10 min break
		- two sessions: 25 w - 5b - 25work- 5break
	- when mark the task as done (maybe configurable as well)
		- you are required to enter comment/ reflections?
		- (advanced) set options: what actions are required to consider a task finished
		- no snooze
8. a waiver option?
