# Musk's adivce for young people

1. work hard. like 80 hours a week.
	-  wow I can try hard too
2. work with competent people
3. try to see the core of the issues; stop blindly following what everyone says
	- for example how to solve traffic jam?
		- it's about the traffic flow
			- finding cheap technology to build underground driveways
4. try things you want to do when young, otherwise too much responsibility to take on later in life

maybe the most amazing thing about Musk is that he actually started off self-reliant and not that well off.
