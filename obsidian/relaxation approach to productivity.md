# Relaxation approach to productivity

1. always schedule what you're going to do during free time so the activities serve as incentives to work
2. plan relaxation that gets you away from electronic devices
3. planned relaxation:
	- massage
	- craniosacral
	- art museum?
	- dating
	- very good food?
	- anime series to watch?
