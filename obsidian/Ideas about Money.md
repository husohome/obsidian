1. asset = things that will increase money/ cashflow overtime

my inspo?
	- so going to colleges that don't pay off, buying expensive houses or cars aren't assets! They are draining your money

2. always thinking about how to increasing assets.
	- maybe my idea:
		- working on ideas and simply pay people to develop apps, and then use them to increase cash flow.
