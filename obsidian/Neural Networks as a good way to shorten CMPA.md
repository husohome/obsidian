## Neural Networks as a good way to shorten CMPA  

Among the techniques from machine learning, neural networks have found the most recent success in multiple areas[[SH1]](#_msocom_1) . Notably, for example, a neural-network-based model, AlphaStar (Arulkumaran, Cully, & Togelius, 2019, July), outplayed professional Starcraft gamers – a complicated real time strategy game, by a decisive margin, predicting each step. Fields like computer vision, when the computer recognizes photos, has also been propelled by the advances in models in the neural network family. Recommender systems (e.g. Da Silva, 2015) on YouTube are just another example of the success story of neural networks. Examples abound.

While the areas are not directly shortening a test, they are in essence, prediction problems: Playing Starcraft is predictions based on current states of the game; recognizing photos is predictions based on numerified pixels of the photos. That is, the examples demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of neural networks on prediction tasks. The implication is that, as long as shortening an assessment can be reframed as a prediction problem, neural networks have the promise of state-of-the-art performance as well – “exactly how” will be addressed in Method.

Therefore, the current study uses Multilabel Neural Network, a member of the neural network family, to solve this problem with satisfactory performance.
