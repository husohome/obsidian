## CMPA needs to be shortened

As CMPA could take up to 40 minutes to complete, it needs to be shortened. More importantly, shortening CMPA is an especially suitable vehicle for the idea of machine learning as a methodological expansion for social science and education research. This is because it not only has too many (fifty) outcome categories but also features two completely different response formats which bear complex relationships because of the screening process in between. Usually assuming data normality and non-collinearity, traditional quantitative methodology in social science and education research may not offer the best fitting tools here. Thus, a tool is borrowed from machine learning. If we succeed, an obvious implication would be that, with the help of machine Learning, it becomes possible for social science and education research to handle assessments that have items with many categories as well as having complex, non-collinear relationships among items.
