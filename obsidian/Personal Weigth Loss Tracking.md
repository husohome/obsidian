# Weight Loss Tracking


1. trying keto
	 - high fat (low hunger)
	 - very low carbs
		 - 25g or less sugar, aim for no added sugar at all
			 - think of sugar as addiction/ poison
	 - result:
		 - very hard to maintain!
		 - but less hunger for sure!

2. reintroducing sugar to compare it with keto
	- feels addictive but good
	- actually might be able to sleep
	- may be harmful, not sure(?)
	- more tiredom immediately after intake
	- result:
		- feels a lot fatter!

3. trying strict keto + IF (not strict) + exercising
