## CMPA result format

The final results of CMPA are a list of college majors the respondent might prefer along with a “preference score” for each, suggested to be used only for personal reference. The comparison across the preference scores is intended as ipsative, or, within-person, and is meaningless across individuals. See Figure 3.11.
