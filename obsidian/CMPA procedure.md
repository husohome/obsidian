## CMPA procedure

The assessment consists of two stages. Stage-1 asks respondents to rate their degrees of agreement (a typical Likert-type scale without a midpoint option) with statements like “I would like to spend time learning about A”, where A is a phrase text-mined and extracted for a major. For example, “I would like to spend time learning about the molecular basis of life” is for biology. Stage-2 are pairwise forced choices, which ask the respondents to choose from two options, with the stem “I would rather spend time learning A or B”, with A and B being phrases indicating the content of two majors. In every step of assessment, majors that received low points within-person would be screened out, resulting in an adaptive test increasing personalized for the respondent.

To save time, Stage-1 only assessed thirty-three (instead of all 50) majors because some of the majors are lumped into a few “general” majors. For example, the four majors, “accounting”, “business”, “economics”, and “marketing” are grouped under “general business”. See Table 3.1 for the list of majors assessed and the correspondence between general and specific majors.
