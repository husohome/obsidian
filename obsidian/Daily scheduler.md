# Daily scheduler

#java #coding #productivity #productivity-book-keeper #project

This is part of the [[java project - productivity bookkeeper]] project


1. a daily scheduler (looks like a weekly scheduler, i.e., [[Scheduling how to execute the course plan (weekly schedule)]])
	- course pane/ box
		- here it's the course and hours scheduled for the week (so it has how many credits/hours to work on too)
			- example:
				- will be something like
				- java (which is a course) 3 credits (3 hours, tomato) (which is the total scheduled time)
				- dissertation 2 hr
				- ... I'll call these course execution units
		- the user drags the course and drop it down the bottom using the same mechanism as the weekly scheduler
	- schedule pane/ box
		- asks how many of the scheduled (duration basic unit is tomato?)
			- if there's only one hour planed the
		- commit to daily plan
			- to-do list
	- there's maybe no need to navigate to different view
- should provide ways to zoom-in and out the scheduler scale (from daily to weekly and vice versa).
