# High-School-Book-Keeper Approach to Productivity

well I invented this?
maybe  I could write an app about it?

1. pretend you were taking courses and assign them credits. 
	- One credit is 50 min (including a 10-min break) per week
	- Depending on your workload, assign yourself a certain number of credits per week
		- example: 80 hours (according to [[Musk's advice]])
	- courses are whatever difficult/ time consuming stuff you need to work on
 	- example courses and credits:
		- Dissertation Writing (30 credits)
		- Dissertation Experiment and Coding (30 credits)
		- Side Coding (6 credits)
		- Side Translation Project (6 credits)
		- Java Course Gjun (6 credits)
		- Java Practice (6 credits)
		- Exercise (6 credits)
		- Idea ()
		- Excursion (6 credits)
2. you could schedule some special sessions
	- idea session: just working on ideas (maybe use obsidian note?)
	- meditation, exercise, shopping, excursions, etc.
3.  however, instead of pre-scheduling your courses, like in high school, you schedule the course a day before or on the day you want to do it, and track your credits spent
		- think of yourself as needing to work 12 - 14 hours a day, so you'd have four major chunks of time, each chunk about 3 - 4 hours and arrange as such
		- example according to the previous example of courses and credits
			- Today:
				- Java practice 6 credits (then you take away 6 credits for the assigned credits) ~ maybe I could write an app for this using spring boot?
		- maybe use obsidian note or excel to track the hours left (like how you would track your expenses) and maybe reflect this one your daily to-do list, or spring-boot/ Vue?
4. go ahead and execute (currently I'm testing how this works)
	- results are tracked here: [[Implementation - High-School-Book-Keeper approach to productivity]] and here: [[Exp - Is working 80 hours a week possible]]
	- this may be done through this app I'm building: [[java project - productivity bookkeeper]]
