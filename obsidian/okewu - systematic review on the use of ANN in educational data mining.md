# Systematic review on the use of ANN in educational data mining

#dissertation #lit-review

[[Disseration Master]]

## Inspirations from this
1. it may be necessary for us to "locate" ANN in the context of machine learning
	1. feels like we need to mention supervised learning
	2. and we use a single-layer network (which is the least common)
2. Neural networks are good for
	1. classification
	2. pattern recognition

3. yes, there are quite a lot of ANN in educational data mining, but mostly it's about how students' learning performance is predicted by what. to our knowledge, no one has used ANN for test shortening
